# Docker-Py-ReVanced

A little python script that will help you in building Revanced and Revanced-Extended [apps](#note)

Note - I prefer [Revanced Extended](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches/tree/revanced-extended) more
(for YouTube & YouTube Music) hence the YouTube and YouTube Music builds in this repo are from
Revanced Extended.

## Pre-Built APKs
You can get pre-built apks [here](https://t.me/revanced_apkss)

## Build Yourself

You can use any of the following methods to build.

- üöÄIn GitHub (**_`Recommended`_**)
   1. Fork the project.
   ![fork]
   2. Add `ENVS` (**optional**) secret to the repo. Required only if you want to cook specific apps/versions.

         - Go to actions tab
           ![action_0]
         - Check the status of build, It should look green.

3. By default, it will build [all](#note) build app supported by Revanced team. If you
   don't
   want to waste time and build only few apps. Add the apps you want to build in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in
   `GitHub secrets` in the format
   ```ini
   PATCH_APPS=<REVANCED_APPS_NAME>
   ```
   Example:
   ```ini
   PATCH_APPS=youtube,twitter,reddit
   ```
4. If you want to exclude any patch. Set comma separated patch in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets`
   (Recommended) in
   the format
   ```ini
   EXCLUDE_PATCH_<REVANCED_APPS_NAME>=<PATCH_TO_EXCLUDE-1,PATCH_TO_EXCLUDE-2>
   ```
   Example:
   ```dotenv
    EXCLUDE_PATCH_YOUTUBE=custom-branding,hide-get-premium
    EXCLUDE_PATCH_YOUTUBE_MUSIC=yt-music-is-shit
   ```
   If you are using `Revanced Extended.` Add `_EXTENDED` in exclude options.
   Example:
   ```dotenv
    EXCLUDE_PATCH_YOUTUBE_EXTENDED=custom-branding-red,custom-branding-blue,materialyou
    EXCLUDE_PATCH_YOUTUBE_MUSIC_EXTENDED=custom-branding-music
   ```
5. If you want to build a specific version . Add `version` in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` (Recommended)
   in the format
   ```ini
   <APPNAME>_VERSION=<VERSION>
   ```
   Example:
   ```ini
   YOUTUBE_VERSION=17.31.36
   YOUTUBE_MUSIC_VERSION=X.X.X
   TWITTER_VERSION=X.X.X
   REDDIT_VERSION=X.X.X
   TIKTOK_VERSION=X.X.X
   WARNWETTER_VERSION=X.X.X
   SPOTIFY_VERSION=X.X.X
   ```
6. If you want to build `latest` version, whatever latest is available(including
   beta) .
   Add `latest` in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` (Recommended) in the format
   ```ini
   <APPNAME>_VERSION=latest
   ```
   Example:
   ```ini
   YOUTUBE_VERSION=latest
   YOUTUBE_MUSIC_VERSION=latest
   TWITTER_VERSION=latest
   REDDIT_VERSION=latest
   TIKTOK_VERSION=latest
   WARNWETTER_VERSION=latest
   SPOTIFY_VERSION=latest
   ```

7. If you don't want to use default keystore. You can provide your own by placing it
   inside `apks` folder. And adding the name of `keystore-file` in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets`
   (Recommended) in the format
   ```dotenv
    KEYSTORE_FILE_NAME=revanced.keystore
   ```
8. If you want to use Revanced-Extended for YouTube and YouTube Music. Add the following adding

   ```
   or disable it with (default)
   ```dotenv
    BUILD_EXTENDED=False
   ```
9. For Telegram Upload.
   1. Set up a telegram channel, send a message to it and forward the message to
      this telegram [bot](https://t.me/username_to_id_bot)
   2. Copy `id` and save it to `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`<br>
      ![chat id]
   3. `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` - Telegram provides BOT_TOKEN. It works as sender. Open [bot](https://t.me/BotFather) and
       create one copy api key<br>
      ![bot api]
   4. `TELEGRAM_API_ID`  - Telegram API_ID is provided by telegram [here](https://my.telegram.org/apps)<br>
     ![tg api]
   5. `TELEGRAM_API_HASH` - Telegram API_HASH is provided by telegram [here](https://my.telegram.org/apps)<br>
     ![tg api hash]
   6. After Everything done successfully the actions secrets of the repository will look something like<br>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dzC1KFa.png" width="400">
10. Configuration defined in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` will override the configuration in `.env` file. You can use this
    fact to define your normal configurations in `.env` file and sometimes if you want to build something different just
    once. Add it in `GitHub secrets` or you can ignore `.env` file and always use `GitHub secrets` because to modify
    `.env` you need to modify the repo. Edit it and make a commit.
11. If you want to build YouTube with `original icon` and `custom branding icon` both. Add `BUILD_OG_BRANDING_YOUTUBE`
    in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` (Recommended) in the format
    ```dotenv
     BUILD_OG_BRANDING_YOUTUBE=True
    ```

    You can also specify the branding patch to use for custom icon build. This can be done with by adding
    `BRANDING_PATCH` in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` (Recommended) in the format
    ```dotenv
     BRANDING_PATCH=custom-branding-icon-blue
    ```
12. You can build only for a particular arch in order to get smaller apk files.This can be done with by adding comma
    separated `ARCHS_TO_BUILD` in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` (Recommended) in the format.
    ```dotenv
     ARCHS_TO_BUILD=arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a
    ```
    Possible values for `ARCHS_TO_BUILD` are: `armeabi-v7a`,`x86`,`x86_64`,`arm64-v8a`
    Make sure you are using `revanced-extended` as `revanced` doesn't support this.
13. You can scan your build apks files with VirusTotal. For that, Add `VT_API_KEY` in `GitHub secrets`.
